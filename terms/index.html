                <h3 id="terms-of-use">TERMS OF USE</h3>

<p>Welcome to the DragonChain, LLC. (“DC”, “Our”, “Us”, “We”) website (“Site”).  From this Site you or the company or other legal entity for which you have the legal authority to act (each, “You” or “Your”), may set up a user account (“Account”) and purchase licenses to DC software and development services (“Products”).  The Site and the Products available through it are the sole property of DC.  You may only use the Site and the Products if You agree to and comply with these Terms of Use (“TOU”), the End User License Agreement (“EULA”) or Terms of Service (“TOS”) applicable to the specific Products You purchase, and DC’s Privacy Policy, Disclaimer and Copyright terms located at [link] (collectively, the “Terms”).</p>

<p><strong>THESE TERMS CREATE A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND DC.  BY CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON WHEN YOU SET UP YOUR ACCOUNT YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.  IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TERMS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL.</strong></p>

<p><strong>IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO ACCEPT THE TERMS OR BY TECHNICAL MEANS BYPASS/DISABLE THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, THEN BY INSTALLING, COPYING, DOWNLOADING, ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS SITE YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.</strong></p>

<h3 id="access-to-the-products">Access to the Products</h3>
<p>DC is granting You access to the Site and the Products on the express condition that You agree to and comply with all of the Terms.</p>

<p>YOUR USE OF ANY PAYMENT METHOD, INCLUDING WHERE PERMITTED, ANY CRYPTOCURRENCY,  IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND POLICIES APPLICABLE TO SUCH PAYMENT.</p>

<h3 id="cancellation-changes-to-subscription-terms">Cancellation; Changes to Subscription Terms</h3>

<p>We may cancel or suspend your Subscription at any time with immediate effect if We determines in Our sole discretion that You (a) have acted in a manner inconsistent with applicable laws or ordinances; (b) breached any of the Terms; (c) engaged in any fraud or abuse concerning Dragons or Your use of them; (d) violated any provision of the EULA or TOS; or (e) engaged in any conduct or act for which We may terminate or suspend your access to the Site.  We may also take appropriate administrative or legal action if any of the items listed above occurs. Nothing contained in these Terms shall limit DC in its exercise of any legal or equitable rights or remedies.</p>

<p>If We amend these Terms, We will revise the “last updated” date located at the bottom of these Terms. For changes to these Terms that We consider to be material, We will place a notice on the Site to read substantially as “Updated Terms” with a link to the changes for up to three (3) weeks or some other amount of time that We determine in our discretion. If You continue to use the Site by purchasing Dragons or Products or by logging onto your Account or in any other way after these Terms have been changed, You will be deemed to have read, understood and unconditionally consented to and agreed to such changes. The most current version of these Terms will be available on the Site and will supersede all previous versions of these Terms.
Use of Dragons</p>

<p>Dragons may only be used to purchase Products as provided below.  DC will not redeem them for cash and You represent and warrant that You will not use them to engage in any gambling activity or other activity prohibited by federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations.  You may only redeem Dragons as provided in these Terms. Dragons will not be replaced, reissued or credited if lost, stolen or otherwise altered or destroyed.  Once You have redeemed your Dragons, there are no refunds, returns or exchanges for additional Dragons, cash, or other goods and services.</p>

<h3 id="purchasing-product-licenses-and-services">Purchasing Product Licenses and Services</h3>

<p>You may purchase licenses to software products (“Software”) and/or development services (“Services”) from the Site by completing the applicable purchase order.  By placing an purchase order, You agree to the EULA or TOS applicable to the Software or Services covered by the purchase order.</p>

<p>DC uses a flexible pricing system under which You may purchase Software licenses or Services by using Dragons issued with Your Subscription or by purchasing Dragons for cash or other Payment Method, or using certain DC-approved cryptocurrencies “Bitcoin” and “Ethereum”.  You may purchase Dragons when You purchase access to Software or Services, or in advance and use them later to purchase access to Software and Services.  However, You need to have an active and current Subscription to use Dragons to purchase Products from the Site.  As a result, if Your Subscription is terminated or is cancelled for any reason, You will no longer be able to use the Dragons associated to Your Account to make purchases from the Site.</p>

<p>Dragons are interchangeable.  That is, unless otherwise indicated for specific Software products or Services, during Your Subscription Term You may apply Dragons to any combination of Software and Services available from the Site.  However, a specified number of Dragons is required to use the Software and Services and this may change over time, at DC’s sole option and without prior notice.  As a result, the quantity of Software or Services you may purchase with Dragons may increase or decrease.</p>

<p>In addition, the terms applicable to Your use of Dragons may vary depending on the Software or Service You purchase.  Before purchasing any Software or Service You should review the applicable terms and conditions as set forth in the EULA and TOS.  We reserve the right to modify, amend or revise the terms applicable to Your use of the Dragons as well as these Terms and terms of the EULA and TOS, even though even though these changes may affect Your ability to use the Dragons You have already purchased.</p>

<h3 id="eula-and-tos">EULA and TOS</h3>
<p>Your right to access and use the Products and this Site is governed by the Terms and, as applicable, the EULA and/or TOS applicable to your purchase, all of which are subject to change in Our sole discretion.  The EULA and TOS contain limitations on Your use of the Software and Services, including the work product that We may deliver to You as part of the Services.  You must comply with all of these limitations and if You fail to do so DC may terminate or suspend Your access to and use of this Site, the Software and/or Services as provided in these Terms and the applicable EULA and TOS.  Except as expressly set out herein and in the applicable EULA and TOS, DC retains all rights, including copyright, in the Software, the Services and related work product and does not grant You any rights or license with respect to any of the above.  DC reserves all rights not expressly granted to You in the Terms, the EULA, and TOS.</p>

DC shall own all rights in the Aggregate Data.</p>

<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>
<p>The Site and Products have the ability to monitor Your use of them so that DC may assess the performance and capabilities of the Site and the Products. You (and each Authorized User) hereby grant DC the right to do so.  While the DC may monitor use of the Site and the Products, doing so does not (a) create any obligation by the DC to report the results thereof; (b) constitute notice to DC of any fault or error in the Site or the Products or a violation of the Terms, EULA or TOS; or (d) limit DC’s remedies for any violation of any of the above.</p>

The Host has committed to implementing industry standard technical and security measures to protect the Site and Your data from unauthorized access.  DC makes no warranty regarding security and shall not be liable for any breach of security or unauthorized access to the Site or Your data.</p>

<p>The following provisions will apply if there is no existing non-disclosure agreement between You and DC. You will maintain the confidentiality of all information related to the Software and Services and all other information designated by DC as “Confidential Information” with at least the same degree of care that You use to protect Your own confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care under the circumstances.
